# Abstract

While corruption is a classic collective action problem, prevalent anti-corruption initiatives are dominated by a principal-agent framework. Our current effort does not pay sufficient attention to facilitating collective action—-in other
words, building the political will to enforce reform—-leading to widespread implementation
gap. The paper discusses two case studies of ADB member countries, Indonesia and Vietnam, to illustrate the importance of political will in anti-corruption efforts. Aware that it is
difficult for the ADB to get involved in political matters, the paper proposes the Indicators
and Benchmarks strategy as a technical approach to solving a political problem. The last
section concludes and emphasizes that this strategy is not yet another new tool to directly
“cure” corruption. Rather, it is a change in mindset, geared towards cultivating an enabling
environment for the people to fight against corruption themselves
